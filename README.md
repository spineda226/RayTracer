# RayTracer
Building a Ray Tracer in C++ (CSC 500 - Independent Study)

Part 1
- Created all the classes for the geometry
- Constructed viewing rays from a virtual camera
- Compute ray-object intersections for spheres and planes
- Color pixels based on pigment of closest intersection (raycast)
- Write out resulting image

Part 2
- Shading for non-reflectie surfaces (Blinn-Phong model)
- Shadows 
- Correct images for camera with arbitrary world view
-
